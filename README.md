This is the BetterRest partial code along project from 100 days of SwiftUI.  BetterRest is a simple iOS app that calculates your bedtime based on how much coffee you drink, what time you want to get up, and how many hours of sleep your desire.  The calculations are done with a simple machine learning algorithm created with Apple's Core ML.
